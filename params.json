  "body": "### Bio\r\n\r\nI am currently a first year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UCSD.   \r\nI spent my first three years of undergraduate study at Beijing Institute of Technology, majored in information engineering, where both my parents graduated and met each other. My fourth year was exchanged at UCSD, and I am glad to have five more years living in wonderful San Diego.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Research Interest\r\n\r\nMy research interest is machine learning, computational neuroscience and cognitive science. I do believe the next era of AI would arise with the further understanding of the human brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\nI traveled to Kiev, Ukraine and visited the Chernobyl in July 2016.  \r\nI just started learning Ballet, and I do yoga occasionally.  \r\nI am a runner, Marathon is on my wish list.   \r\nI love Woody Allen's movies. I love Natalie Portman. I love Wolverine.  ",
